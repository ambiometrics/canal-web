##Usage
Just download and open *ca.html* in a browser. You may need to *allow file access from files* if you running it locally. For example, you may need to run *Chrome* with the following command: `chrome.exe --allow-file-access-from-files`.

##Contributing
Feel free to fork and pull requests. If you find a error you're welcome to fix it. I'm not a web compatibility enthusiast so I think there are many cross-browser issues and unhandled errors.
